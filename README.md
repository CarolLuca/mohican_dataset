## Dataset for the Mohican StartUp
This dataset obtains public data about companies such as the name, the motto, the logo and the ads published.

We propose to determine a set of templates that can help us generate sugestive ads based on the characteristics above being provided .

Therefore, we want to achieve a model that can understand this small ecosystem of each company and make them more fitting within the publishing ads platforms.
